## Overview 

W. Avy is looking for assurance that a surf shop and ice cream parol is a good investment on the island of Oahu.  W. Avy would like an analysis of the weather on Oahu, to understand if it is a good location for such a shop.

Using a .sqlite database of Hawaii weather data and Jupyter Notebook to write the Python code, I have provided the necessary analysis to make this business decision.

## Results

In determining if asurf shop and ice cream parol is a wise business decision, looking at the temperature is a good place to start.  Who doesn't like ice cream at the beach as a fun treat after surfing?

Looking at the middle (June) and end of the year (December) will provide us with a quick, but useful snapshot of how the temperatures can vary.

Reasons a Surf Shop and Ice Cream Parol would work year round
1. The temperature from June to December remains fairly steady in the lower to mid 70's, perfect ice cream weather.
2. While the low in December can get into the mid 50's, it is less that 25% of the time, still leaving plenty of days for ice cream.
3. The air temperature primarly in the 70's makes for great surfing weather, warm in the sun and cool in the water.
4. The temperature is never so hot that the ice cream would melt before you could eat it or make the sand so hot that you can't make it to the beach.

## Summary: 

Based on temperature, Oahu will make for a great place to open a surf shop and ice cream parol.
